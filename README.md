## Deep Learning Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for CIFAR-10 Cat Images
This project implements a Deep Learning Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using the TensorFlow package. The model is specifically designed to generate realistic images of cats from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Project Overview


The goal of this project is to develop a generative model that can produce realistic cat images. By leveraging the DCGAN architecture, the model is trained on cat images extracted from the CIFAR-10 dataset over 1000 epochs.
Dataset
CIFAR-10: This is a widely used dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. For this project, only the images labeled as "cat" are utilized.
## Model Architecture
The DCGAN consists of two main components:

Generator: A neural network that generates new data instances.

Discriminator: A neural network that evaluates the authenticity of the generated data.
The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game. The generator aims to produce realistic images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator strives to distinguish between real and fake images.
